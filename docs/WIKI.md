# Overview

The Concisys BOM Quoter is a Python-based CLI program that is designed based off of the current Concisys ERP Material Inquiry feature, in which users (e.g., program managers) upload a _Bill of Materials (BOM)_ excel file to quote part items based on available vendors. It enables users to upload a BOM from their computer via the command line and returns the file with available part items and their attributes to determine accurate labor price quotes.

While the BOM Quoter has many similar functions as the ERP feature, this program also allows the user to compare pricing results based on the quantity order. For example, if a original quantity order is currently being quoted for 100 boards but a customer would also like to know the quote for a later time with 1000 boards of the same type of order, the quantity price will be determined and compared in the BOM Quoter.

# How it works

## Project Overview

[BOM Quoter Repository](https://github.com/concisys-dev0/bom_quoter)

The project folder hierarchy is as follows:

- `assets`: contains Excel files for BOM file configurations
	- `sample`: sample BOM files to show end results
	- `templates`: empty BOM template
- `config`: contains all the configuration files needed to start the program
- `docs`: BOM Quoter documentation and licensing
- `temp`: contains corresponding JSON files to temporary store API credentials and results
- `utils`: library containing API and scraping operations
- `main.py`: Main CLI program
- `setup.py`: setup script to initiate `utils` library

## Python Libraries

The Python language was preferred over other languages for building the BOM Quoter due to its versatility, simplicity, and widespread adoption. With its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, it provides a solid foundation for connecting to various APIs while handling complex data operations in addition to its support of data flow and compatibility with data formats, such as JSON, XML and CSV.

The code was written in functional program approach to handle data flow. It utilizes various Python libraries and modules. The main libraries used within this program include, but are not limited to:

 - Excel file handing: _pandas_, _numpy_, _openpyxl_, _json_
 - API Requests: _requests_, _requests-oauthlib_, _webbrowser_
 - Web Scraping: _selenium_, _webdriver-manager_, _beautifulsoup4_
 - Other libraries include: _time_, _sys_, _os_, _pathlib_, _operator_, _schedule_, _math_, _setuptools_

## Vendor APIs

The BOM Quoter allows the user to briefly connect to three RESTful APIs from DigiKey, Mouser Electronics, and TTI and returns data in JSON format.

# User Guide

## Setting up the BOM

**Required**: 
- Customer BOM file: BOM file from the customer or your own BOM file to upload
- BOM_input_template: found in the `templates` folder; the required 'BOM' and 'Sheet1' sheets needs to be copied from this file and placed in your BOM file

1. In the project directory, open or obtain the `BOM_input_template.xlsx` file from the templates directory.
2. Open the BOM input template. There are two sheets that are required for the BOM Quoter processing to be successful: 'BOM' and 'Sheet1'. Note: do NOT delete or change the name of these sheets in your BOM file upload as it will create syntax errors.
3. Instead, to avoid errors, create a new copy of the 'BOM' sheet and 'Sheet1' sheet in your BOM file and copy/paste the columns from the respective sheet in the BOM template to your BOM file.
 
    ![gif of copying part Description from customer BOM and BOM file](docs/images/figure3.gif)
 
4. All the cells in the following columns of the 'BOM' sheet are required to be filled:
 
    - ***Item***: line item number
    - ***Reference Designators***: found in original BOM, location of the part on PCB when assemble
    - ***Description*** : description of part
    - ***Manufacturer Part Number***: manufacturing part number
    - ***Quantity***: quantity of part for a single board
        - If item is DNI/Do Not Install put in 0 if you need to keep it in the BOM
    - ***Qty Need***: the quantity needed to complete quantity order (more than 1 board)
    - ***Qty Buy***: the quantity to buy to complete quantity order
    
5. Go to 'Sheet1' that you copied into your BOM file, enter the _Qty Order_ value to the _Qty_ column.
 
    ![Screenshot of Sheet1 with Qty Order](docs/images/figure4.png)
 
6. If there is more than one value in the column, add the Q# Need and Q# Buy to ‘BOM’ where # is _Qty Order_ number. See figures 5 and 6.
    
    ![Additional qty orders](docs/images/figure5.png) ![Adding addtional qty order to BOM sheet](docs/images/figure6.png)

7. Save your BOM file with the changes from Steps 1-6. Copy the file path; you will paste this into the BOM Quoter when prompted.
 
 You are now ready to upload the BOM file to the BOM Quoter.
 
## Uploading the BOM
1. Run the _concisys-bom-quoter_ program
2. After running the program, you will be prompted to enter the BOM file path. Paste the file path you copied previously and press enter to continue
 
```
Enter the path to the file: C:/path/to/BOM.xlsx
```
 
3. For web scraping results follow the prompt:
 
```
